Feel free to add a description. The general order should be hedge-fund quality datasets followed by research datasets followed by any other datasets.

Please run the trimmer.py in the scripts folder prior to creating a pull request.

**Large files: Please store the file in a zip folder within the folder for that dataset. If it is still too big (100 Mb or larger), please run the compress function in the **'gzipTool.py'** file to compress the file and remove the uncompressed file. Please pay attention to the console. If the compressed file is still over 100 Mb, please use a different method of your choice, but make sure it is under 100 Mb.**

Note: Please avoid Git LFS as Github charges money after using over 1 GB. I am a college student and would rather not pay for Git LFS datapacks.
